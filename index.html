              mcrtech operates under
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rule</a>. You are free to use the
              information in mcrtech in other contexts. However, you should not disclose the identity or affiliation of
              any commenter in mcrtech without first getting their permission.
            </p>
            <p>
              mcrtech is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment
              of participants in any form.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mcrtech chat group aims to provide a safe space where contributors can disclose situations that they
              are currently experiencing. It’s not always the case that the original contributor will be looking for
              advice or feedback. Do not offer unsolicited advice or feedback without first checking the intentions of
              the original comment poster. Specifically, members should only give advice and feedback if the poster
              requested it. If in doubt, check first and use
              <a href="https://resultsmatter.blogspot.com/2007/05/gestalt-protocol.html">the Gestalt Protocol</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This code of conduct applies to all mcrtech spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct
              messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from
              these spaces at the administrators’ discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some mcrtech spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made available to participants.
              Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. For example, general political
              discussion should be contained to the #politics channel, which is opt-in. Political debate can get heated,
              but robust debate around ideas will be tolerated, although criticism of the person holding those views is
              not permitted.
            </p>
            <p>Harassment includes:</p>

              <li>Threats of violence</li>

            <h3>Reporting</h3>
            <p>
              If a member of mcrtech is harassing you, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
              concerns, please contact one of the following members of the admin team directly by DM: @chrismatheson
              @cnorthwood @Hakim Cassimally @Parul Singh @s10wen @Tom
            </p>
            <p>
              This code of conduct applies to mcrtech spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of mcrtech
              outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by
              mcrtech members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and
              harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from
              mcrtech based on their past behaviour, including behaviour outside mcrtech spaces and behaviour towards
              people who are not in mcrtech.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to protect volunteer admins from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we
              believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted
              without response.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will respect confidentiality requests to protect victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly
              name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints or privately warn third parties about them
              if we believe that doing so will increase mcrtech members’ safety or the general public. We will not name
              harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
            </p>

            <h3>Consequences</h3>
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
            <p>
              If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the administrators may take any action they deem
              appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all mcrtech spaces and identification of the participant
              as a harasser to other mcrtech members or the general public.
            </p>

            <h3>Advertising</h3>
            <p>
              A team of dedicated admins runs mcrtech for the enjoyment and benefit of its members. Our admins give up
              their own time to foster and develop the community, and as such, we aim to keep the community an
              advertising-free zone. One exception to this is the #show channel, where community members can share
              projects or work they are launching that is of interest to the mcrtech community. If your only posts are
              in #show, however, we deem that to be advertising, rather than a place for community members to show their
              work. Similarly, events that are being run in or of specific interest to the Manchester/North West
              community are permitted to be posted in the #events channel, although repeated posting of the same event
              (other than reasonable reminders) will be considered spam. If you are an event organiser who only posts in
              #events, this is permitted but please ask an admin first. We take a firm stance on members posting
              advertisements of any kind in the community, and we reserve the right to remove posts that fall afoul of
              this rule. An admin will inform the poster, and an admin will remove persistent offenders from the Slack
              team.
            </p>

            <h3>Recruiting</h3>
            <p>
              We encourage members to share open job postings, and we have a #jobs channel specifically for this
              purpose. Re-posting across other channels or requesting re-posts in private channels is forbidden. We also
              support member-to-member recommendations. Soliciting via direct message is not permitted, except for
              contacting a poster of a job via Direct Message unless they have specifically asked not to do that.
              Soliciting includes pitching an agency or outsourcing via DM to a job poster that's clearly looking for
              permanent members of staff. Unpaid employment or anything else the admins consider exploitative employment,
              jobs based outside of the North West, or remote jobs being advertised by a company without a link to the
              area are not permitted. When posting a job, please include some basic details and not just a “DM me for
              more info” request - we highly encourage posting salaries on job ads (you are likely to be asked what the
              range is anyway, if you do not). Any discussions on a particular post should occur in a thread on that post.
              Although detail is encouraged, please do not post extremely long job ads (more than a screen high),
              especially shortly after a more recent post, as this can be seen as trying to bury your competition.
            </p>

            <h3>Examples of behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              The following are examples of behaviours we wish to discourage, and alternative suggestions that can help
              build a more positive community

                  response to another question)

                  Language choice is often due to wider constraints where the context isn’t clear. Making fun of
                  particular languages, especially if someone is new to coding and that’s what they’ve learnt can be
                  discouraging and elitist.

                  Although it can be tempting to vent, attacks on particular job roles within the wider tech sector are
                  rarely constructive and can be hurtful to people who have those roles. Rephrasing it in a more
                  specific and actionable way is more helpful to the wider community to identify bad apples to avoid. It
                  can be helpful to name the recruiter/company to advise others of those who have bad practice to be
                  avoided.

                  This hiring manager is such an idiot, they’re asking for Perl experience for a front-end role,

                  I think you’ll find it hard to find a front-end developer with these particular skills, you might want
                  to review the skills list or the job title at least to accurately reflect what you want it to do.
